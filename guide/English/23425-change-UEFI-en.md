#### Reboot into fastboot mkde
- Boot your NABU into **fastboot mode** by holding down the **`volume down`** button while rebooting with a USB cable connected
- Alternatively, run the below command while booted in Android
```cmd
adb reboot bootloader
```

### Boot the modded recovery
> While in fastboot mode, replace `path\to\recovery.img` with the actual path of the recovery image
```cmd
fastboot boot path\to\recovery.img
```

### Make a backup of your existing boot image
```cmd
adb shell "dd if=/dev/block/platform/soc/1d84000.ufshc/by-name/boot$(getprop ro.boot.slot_suffix) of=/tmp/normal_boot.img" && adb pull /tmp/normal_boot.img
```

### Assign letters to WINNABU and ESPNABU
> Run the **DriveLetterAssigner** and click **`YES`** to automatically assign the letters **X** and **Y** to **WINNABU** and **ESPNABU**

#### Enabling test signing
```cmd
bcdedit /store Y:\EFI\Microsoft\BOOT\BCD /set "{default}" testsigning on
```

```cmd
bcdedit /store Y:\EFI\Microsoft\BOOT\BCD /set "{default}" recoveryenabled no

```cmd
mountvol y: /d
```

```cmd
adb reboot bootloader
 ```
